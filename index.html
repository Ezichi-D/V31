      <p>
        From the moment I noticed you and we got to talking, something felt different. You're smart, ambitious, you know what you want, you tend to bring sparkle in places you find yourself and let's not forget very importantly you're beautiful. You're just amazing in so many ways...
        You make moments warmer, conversations easier, make me smile, your voice is like a tranquilizer to me that the sound of it is soothing and just gives me this feeling of comfort and peace. I love our everyday conversations that I'm always looking forward to, its really to the point that my day feels incomplete if I don't hear from you.
        There's so much I'd love to say about you but my words may fall short of expressing how I truly feel.
        I just want you to know that you are special to me in ways I can't fully explain.
        And honestly… I’d love to spend Valentine’s Day with you.
      </p>
