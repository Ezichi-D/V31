      <p>
       From the moment I noticed you and we started talking, something felt different. You’re smart and ambitious. 
       You know what you want, you bring sparkle wherever you go, and — very importantly — you’re beautiful. 
       You’re amazing in so many ways. You warm every moment, make conversations effortless, and make me smile. 
       Your voice is like a tranquilizer — soothing, comforting, and peaceful.
I love our daily conversations. I look forward to them so much that my day feels incomplete if I don’t hear from you. 
There’s so much I want to say about you, and yet words still fall short of how I truly feel. 
Please know that you’re special to me in ways I can’t fully explain. 
Honestly… I would love to spend Valentine’s Day with you.
PS: “Every day with you adds a color to my life I didn’t know was missing.”
